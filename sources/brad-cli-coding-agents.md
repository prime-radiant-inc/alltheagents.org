A curated list of **110+ CLI coding agents** — AI-powered tools that live in your terminal, read/edit repos, and run commands — plus the **harnesses** that orchestrate, sandbox, or extend them.

> **Last updated:** 2026-08-17

### What is a CLI coding agent?

A CLI coding agent is an AI-powered tool that runs in your terminal and can autonomously read, write, and execute code in your repository. Unlike chat-based assistants, these agents have direct access to your filesystem, shell, and dev tools — they can edit files, run tests, commit changes, and iterate on errors. Think of them as AI pair programmers that live where you already work: the command line.
